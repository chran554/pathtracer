= Pathtracer

A pathtracer written in go (golang) for testing out pathtracing ideas and algorithms as well as learning the go programming language.

== How to run

The renderer accepts a render scene file as program argument.

There are several go programs in the `cmd` directory that will create a scene file.
Run one of those programs to create a scene file.

=== Build and run pathracer for a scene file

You can use a script to conveniently build and execute a scene file creation program and then build and run the pathtracer for that created scene file.

The produced result will end up in the `rendered` directory.

`% .build_and_render_animation.sh <animation name>`

Animation name is the same as the directory name for the main file for the scene file.
For example:

`% .build_and_render_animation.sh cornellbox`

This will build and run the rendering of a cornell box image.

== Features

* Load scene-files (json-based file format) capable of multi frame animations.
* Pathtracing algorithm
* Primitives: sphere, disc (circle on plane), triangle (facet)
* Reflection (mirror)
* Color definitions by RGB
* Texture projections: sphere (equirectangular), cylindrical, flat (parallel)
* Progressive/recursive pixel rendering, a quite useful overview after only 5% rendering.
* Bounding boxes
* Super sampling: Anti alias
* Super sampling: DOP - Depth of field (focal distance and "aperture size")
* Save image in RAW-format ("praw") for post light editing.
* Sending broadcast (UDP) messages of rendered pixels to render monitor

=== TODO

* Refraction - using refraction index
* Refraction - color absorption in gas and liquid (solid) using Beer-Lambert Law
* ...
