Some images to illustrate renderer functionality.

== Cornell box

It doesn't look much to the world, but it is the hello world of path tracing.
It is used to show the pathtracer (as opposed to raytracer) features out of the box such as area lights, soft shadows, corner shadows, and color bleeding from nearby surfaces.
It do also show the lack of point (and very small) lights that is out of the box features for raytracing.

Just look at 'em bleed'n walls!

== Material - Reflection

Reflection is not just "mirror" parameter on materials, but it is split in two parameters to simulate metal properties. The two parameters are "glossiness" and "roughness".

Glossiness is the parameter that is the common "mirror" parameter that most tracers implement that is the normal reflection control.

Roughness is how rough the mirror surface is, much like the real world material "brushed aluminum".

.Light green sphere with reflective parameters glossiness (increasing from left=0.0 to right=1.0) and roughness (increasing from bottom=0.0 to top=1.0)

A short animation clip can be found at https://vimeo.com/758989253[Vimeo] (it should be played in a loop though).

== Depth of Field (DOF)

Depth of Field with a configurable aperture at the camera.
The depth of field depends on both aperture size (radius) and focal length.

Read the details on xref:dof/dof.adoc[how DOF is implemented].

.Depth of field using aperture 12.0 (in units, not actual 12f as in camera lenses) and "view plane distance" (the distance to perfect focus point) 2000.

== Aperture shape

A funny and fancy, but not so useful, feature is the ability to change the aperture shape.
This will have effect in "night shots", much like as in movies with the soft blur out of focus shapes of lights at night.

A round aperture gives round blur shapes and other shapes of the aperture will give... other shapes.

Note that out of focus in the foreground gives the shape upside down and flipped left with right, while out of focus in the background will give shapes "correct" as in the aperture.

Read the details on xref:../dof.adoc[how DOF and free aperture shape is implemented].

== Image projection - Spherical

Spherical projection is made from equirectangular images and allow for an image to be projected onto an object from all angles.

A nifty feature is that you can place your actual scene (objects), camera and lighting within a sphere with spherical projection and you will get an environmental projection dome (sphere) as background.

Note that most of the equirectangular images are twice as wide as they are high.
There are 360 degrees around the sphere and half the amount of degrees (180) from the bottom to the top. As long as the texture image has the proportion 1:2 then the "pixels" of texture will be square (proportion 1:1) at the equator.

Cylindrical projection can be used from any image that is wrapped around a cylinder.

== Image projection - Parallel

Parallel projection can be used from any image that is plainly/straight projected onto a surface.

.Parallel projection. A circular disc and three spheres, all with parallel projection. One sphere share the exact same projection as the disc. The second has a checker pattern and the third has a tree rings pattern projected on them from different angles.
