== Brag 'n' boost

Nope, nothing to brag about yet.... :/

=== Metallic like settings "glossy" and "roughness"

.A Cornell box with "metallic like" settings. Lightning fixed for raw image in post render editor.

Using "glossy" and "roughness" parameters rather than the usual "mirror/diffuse".
The algorithms for metallicness that I tried out, are my own and are most likely not true to the path tracing concept of conservation of energy. (I believe that the algorithms introduce a bit of energy to the system.) +
But hey, nice and pretty decent effect though...

A short animation clip can be found at https://vimeo.com/758989253[Vimeo] (it should be played in a loop though).
