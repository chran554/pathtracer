Some _show off_ gems. Not that many really, as I usually produce images to show off xref:../functionality/functionality.adoc[functionality].

== Cornell box

It doesn't look much to the world, but it is the hello world of path tracing.

Just look at 'em bleed'n walls!

.The classic Cornell box. Color bleeding. Lightning fixed for raw image in post render editor.

== Advent of code 2022 day 12

The programming calendar "Advent of Code" 2022 gave a problem where you had to find the shortest path from one point to another given a height map and a couple of movement constraints from one coordinate in the map to another.

The shortest path was found using an A* search algorithm where each coordinate was a node and with, up to, 4 edges to adjacent coordinates (depending on the movement constraints).

The lava is just a texture added to the "a" height level for visual effect and not really part of the assignment. Looks cool though.

I could not help myself from trying to render an animation of the resulting path over the height map.

The animation can be viewed at https://vimeo.com/user83485151[Vimeo].

== Billiard table with a die

Well, the die is 3 cm in width, so it is a pretty large die... +
But I wanted it to stand out in the image

Really produced to show off the xref:../functionality/dof/dof.adoc["free aperture shape" functionality].
